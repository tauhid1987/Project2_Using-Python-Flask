# Project 2: #

## Flack ##

 In this project, I try to build an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. Finally, Iâ€™ll add two personal touch (delete message and private message section) to my chat application.

# An Online Messaging Service Using Flask: # 

## 1 python files ## 
   - application.py for run program
  
## 4 html templates ##
   - index.html for general page.
   - login.html for login page
   - layout.html for supporting private page
   - private.html for private page 
        
## 1 css files ##
   - style.css for main page 
    
	
## 2 javascript file ##
   - main.js for general page 
   - private.js for private page
